  "about.title": "Meet Hélène",
  "about.p1": "Hélène Prat is an HR leader with nearly 20 years of experience partnering with business teams. She studied Organizational & Social Psychology, where her fascination with group dynamics and the undercurrents that shape behavior first began.",
  "about.p2": "Over a decade ago, while developing a leadership program, she discovered Process Communication (PCM), a powerful methodology that helps individuals build awareness of their personality, motivators, and distress patterns. As a certified trainer and practitioner, she has helped individuals, couples and teams strengthen their communication effectiveness.",

  "about.p4": "Originally from France, Hélène moved to Dublin in 2008, returned to France in 2009, relocated to Sydney with her life partner in 2015, and in 2022 moved back to Europe with their son. Her family has now settled in Hilversum, in the Netherlands.",
  "about.p5": "Her approach blends systemic coaching, effective communication tools, and energy healing practices, supporting her clients in feeling grounded and integrating new insights at their own pace. She is generous, full of life, and brings humor and positivity to everything she does.",
