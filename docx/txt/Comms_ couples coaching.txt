“Rooted Together: A Coaching Journey for Couples Relocating to the Netherlands”
________________________________________
Program Overview
Relocating to a new country is one of the most profound transitions a couple can experience. Beyond logistics and paperwork lies an emotional and relational journey — one that involves excitement, loss, adaptation, and the redefinition of shared identity.
This coaching program supports couples who have recently relocated (or are about to relocate) to the Netherlands in navigating this transition together. Using the ORSC methodology, we help couples manage change, honor their dreams, acknowledge their grief, and consciously co-create their “new normal” — both as individuals and as a couple.

Methodology
Grounded in ORSC principles, this program focuses on the relationship system rather than individual partners. Through systemic mapping, dialogue tools, and experiential exercises, we help couples:
•	Hear the voice of the relationship itself (“What is trying to happen between us?”).
•	Navigate polarity and tension with compassion.
•	Strengthen the resilient core of their “relationship system.”

Rooted Together
A Coaching Journey for Couples Relocating to the Netherlands

Is this move bringing you closer, or quietly pulling you apart?
Relocating to a new country is exciting – and also disorienting. You juggle visas, housing, schools, and a new culture, while underneath the surface your relationship is also going through a major transition. One of you may be stepping into a new role, while the other is reinventing identity, career, and community.
Rooted Together is a coaching program designed to help you navigate this transition as a team so you don’t just move country – you build a new life that feels like home for both of you.
